## 3. Detailed Processes and Workflows

### Maize Delivery and Quality Check

**Steps**:

1. **Maize Arrives in a Truck**:
    - **Details**: When the maize arrives, the delivery truck’s registration number, the supplier’s name, and the expected quantity of maize should be recorded. This step ensures that all incoming deliveries are properly documented and attributed to the correct supplier.
2. **Key In Supplier Information**:
    - For existing Suppliers, their details are auto-fetched. For new supplier details such as contact information, company name, and identification numbers are entered into the system. This information is crucial for tracking the source of the maize and managing future communications or issues.
3. **Quality Check of Raw Maize**:
    - The quality control team performs an initial inspection of the maize. This involves a visual inspection to check for contaminants or defects, measuring moisture levels to ensure they are within acceptable limits, and sampling the maize for laboratory analysis. Only maize meeting the required standards is accepted.
4. **Weighbridge Charges Paid**:
    - Weighbridge charges are calculated based on the size and weight of the truck. These charges are essential for covering the cost of using the weighbridge services. Payment can be made through various methods such as Mpesa, bank transfer, or offset against the maize purchase.
5. **Truck Goes to Weighing Scale**:
    - The truck is weighed on the weighbridge to obtain three key measurements: gross weight (total weight including the truck and maize), tare weight (weight of the truck empty), and net weight (weight of the maize only). These measurements are crucial for calculating the exact quantity of maize delivered and for billing purposes.
6. **Weighbridge Ticket Details Provided to Customer**:
    - A weighbridge ticket is generated, detailing the gross, tare, and net weights. This ticket serves as a receipt for the transaction and is provided to the customer for verification. Including a batch number on the ticket, if possible, enhances traceability and helps in tracking the maize throughout the processing chain.
7. **Batch Number Allocation After Quality Check**:
    - Once the maize passes the quality check, it is assigned a unique batch number. This batch number helps in tracking the maize through various stages of processing and storage, ensuring that any issues can be traced back to the specific batch. It also facilitates inventory management and quality control.
8. **Receiving Bay as Warehouse**:
    - The receiving bay is used as a temporary storage area for the maize immediately after delivery. It functions as a preliminary warehouse where the maize is kept before being moved to a more permanent storage location. Proper management of the receiving bay helps in organizing the maize and preparing it for further processing or storage.
9. **Maize Transferred to Pit**:
    - The maize is moved from the receiving bay to a processing pit or warehouse. The processing pit is a designated area for the initial handling and storage of maize before it undergoes further processing.
10. **Maize Goes to Store or Pit**:
    - Depending on the storage requirements, the maize is placed in either a storage facility or a processing pit. The storage facility is used for longer-term storage of maize, while the processing pit is used for maize that is ready to undergo processing.
11. **Maize Goes to Pit for Processing**:
    - Approved maize is moved to the processing pit where it will undergo further steps such as cleaning, drying, or milling. The processing pit is designed to handle maize through various stages of preparation.
